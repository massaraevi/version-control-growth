#== Objectives ==================================================================

# We will identify clusters using k-means and hierarchical clustering. 
# Next, we will visualize the obtained clusters and we will combine clustering with 
# dimention reduction methods.

# =    2  Data preparation  ====================================================

# We will use a R-built in dataset
# - USArrests

# Subset of the data

data("USArrests") # Loading the data set
df <- scale(USArrests) # Scaling the data

# View the firt 3 rows of the data
head(df, n = 3)

# =    3  Clustering with k-means  ====================================================

# kmeans(x, centers, iter.max = 10, nstart = 1)

# .x: numeric matrix, numeric data frame or a numeric vector
# . centers: Possible values are the number of clusters (k) or a set of initial (distinct)
# cluster centers. If a number, a random set of (distinct) rows in x is chosen as
# the initial centers.
# . iter.max: The maximum number of iterations allowed. Default value is 10.
# . nstart: The number of random starting partitions when centers is a number.
# Trying nstart > 1 is often recommended.

# The function requires to specify the number of clusters. 
# How to choose the right number of expected clusters?

# We will conduct k-means clustering using different values of clusters k. 
# Next, the wss (within sum of square) is drawn according
# to the number of clusters. The location of a bend (knee) in the plot is generally
# considered as an indicator of the appropriate number of clusters.

fviz_nbclust(df, kmeans, method = "wss") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4, linetype = 2)

# Compute k-means with k = 4
set.seed(123)
km.res <- kmeans(df, 4, nstart = 25)

# Print the results
print(km.res)

# Compute the mean of each variables of each cluster

aggregate(USArrests, by=list(cluster=km.res$cluster), mean)

dd <- cbind(USArrests, cluster = km.res$cluster)
head(dd)

# Visualize the results

# If we have a multi-dimensional data set (more than one variable), we can perform
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and to plot data points according to the first
# two principal components coordinates

fviz_cluster(km.res, data = df,
             palette = c("#2E9FDF", "#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             ellipse.type = "euclid", # Concentration ellipse
             star.plot = TRUE, # Add segments from centroids to items
             repel = TRUE, # Avoid label overplotting (slow)
             ggtheme = theme_minimal()
)
# =    4  Clustering with PAM  ====================================================

# pam(x, k, metric = "euclidean", stand = FALSE)

# x: possible values includes:
#   - Numeric data matrix or numeric data frame: each row corresponds to an
# observation, and each column corresponds to a variable.
# - Dissimilarity matrix: in this case x is typically the output of daisy() or
# dist()
# . k: The number of clusters
# . metric: the distance metrics to be used. Available options are "euclidean" and
# "manhattan".
# . stand: logical value; if true, the variables (columns) in x are standardized before
# calculating the dissimilarities. Ignored when x is a dissimilarity matrix.

#Estimate the optimal number of clusters.

fviz_nbclust(df, pam, method = "silhouette")+
  theme_classic()


# Compute PAM with k = 2
pam.res <- pam(df, 2)
# Print the results
print(pam.res)

# The printed output shows:
#   . the cluster medoids: a matrix, which rows are the medoids and columns are
# variables
# . the clustering vector: A vector of integers (from 1:k) indicating the cluster to
# which each point is allocated
# print(km.res)

# If you want to add the point classifications to the original data, use this:
  dd <- cbind(USArrests, cluster = pam.res$cluster)
head(dd, n = 3)

# Visualize the results

# If we have a multi-dimensional data set (more than one variable), we can perform
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and to plot data points according to the first
# two principal components coordinates

fviz_cluster(pam.res,
             palette = c("#00AFBB", "#FC4E07"), # color palette
             ellipse.type = "t", # Concentration ellipse
             repel = TRUE, # Avoid label overplotting (slow)
             ggtheme = theme_classic()
)
# =   5  Hierarchical clustering  ====================================================

# Compute the dissimilarity matrix
# df = the standardized data

res.dist <- dist(df, method = "euclidean")

as.matrix(res.dist)[1:6, 1:6]  #display the first 6 rows and columns of the distance matrix

res.hc <- hclust(d = res.dist, method = "complete")

# Visualize the results

fviz_dend(res.hc, cex = 0.5)# cex: label size

# Cut the dendrogram into different groups

# Hierarchical clustering does not tell us how many clusters there are, 
# or where to cut the dendrogram to form clusters

# Cut tree into 4 groups
grp <- cutree(res.hc, k = 4)
head(grp, n = 4)

# Number of members in each cluster
table(grp)

# Get the names for the members of cluster 1
rownames(df)[grp == 1]


fviz_dend(res.hc, k = 4, # Cut in four groups
          cex = 0.5, # label size
          k_colors = c("#2E9FDF", "#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
          color_labels_by_k = TRUE, # color labels by groups
          rect = TRUE # Add rectangle around groups
)

# Circular dendrogram using the option type = "circular".

fviz_dend(res.hc, cex = 0.5, k = 4,
          k_colors = "jco", type = "circular")

# Phylogenic trees
fviz_dend(res.hc, k = 4, # Cut in four groups
          k_colors = "jco",
          type = "phylogenic", repel = TRUE,
          phylo_layout = "layout.gem")

# Saving dendrogram into a large PDF page
pdf("dendrogram.pdf", width=30, height=15) # Open a PDF
p <- fviz_dend(res.hc, k = 4, cex = 1, k_colors = "jco" ) # Do plotting
print(p)
dev.off()
