- Familiarize with version control concepts.
- Learn how to use GitHub.
- Improve collaboration and efficiency.

## Getting started 

1. "Clone" (copy) the repository to your computer
 - At the top right corner of this page you will see a green button saying "Clone or download". 
 - After clicking this button, you will be given a series of options to copy the contents of the repository locally in your computer. The simplest option for you is the "Open in Desktop".

 - Once you have installed the application, you can return here and click the "Clone or download" button and then follow the instructions of the application. When the repository is cloned in your desktop you can find it in the directory that the application has created for you. Alternatively, you can open the repository locally by selecting Repository->Show in Explorer from the menu of the application.
 - From there, you can start working in Rstudio by setting this as your working directory in Rstudio. Go to Rstudio and from the menu go Session->Set Working Directory->Choose Directory... and pick the directory of the cloned repository. At the right bottom of the Rstudio screen in the "File" pane, choose More->Go To Working Directory. Now, you should be able to see the contents of the repository in your Rstudio screen.
